/// [Logger] is used to emit logging messages.
///
/// There are three types of [Logger]: hierarchical logger - named logger using a
/// hierarchical dot-separated namespaces; detached logger - optionally named
/// logger that isn't part of any logger hierarchy and noop logger - logger
/// that does nothing.
///
/// [Logger] objects may be obtained by calling [Logger.getLogger],
/// [Logger.detached] or [Logger.noop] factories. [Logger.getLogger] returns a
/// hierarchical logger by either creating it or obtaining existing one.
/// [Logger.detached] always returns a new logger regardless to the provided
/// logger [name], typically such loggers are necessary if short-living logger
/// is needed which may be garbage collected later. [Logger.noop] returns
/// a no operation logger.
///
/// Each logger has a severity level reflecting a minimum severity level of
/// logging message this logger cares about (see [Logger.level]). It's possible
/// to register a logging message filter that filters messages based on various
/// criteria (see [Logger.filter]).
///
/// To log a message use [Logger.log] method or one of its derivatives such
/// [Logger.debug], [Logger.info], etc. On each [Logger.log] calls logger
/// performs a severity level check and discarding those messages which have
/// severity level this logger doesn't cares about; if message passes severity
/// level check it then filtered out by a registered logger filter if any.
/// Those messages which pass both checks delegated to a registered handler if
/// any (see [Logger.handler]).
///
/// To bind structured data to the logging context call [Logger.bind] with
/// data represented as a collection of [Field]s. Calling to [Logger.bind] will
/// result into a new context with logging capabilities and bound collection of
/// fields has been created.
